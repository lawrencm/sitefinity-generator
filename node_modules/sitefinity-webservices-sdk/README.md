```

To build and serve the source code on each change:

```bash
$ npm start
```

The output is located in the **dist** folder of the project - **sitefinity-webservices-sdk.js** 

#### Other commands

To build minified source code:

```bash
$ npm run build:prod
```

```

The release output is located in the **dist** folder of the project. It contains the source and documentation.

## Documentation

 To generate the SDK documentation `$ npm run build:release` command must be executed. Docs can be found inside  the **dist/documentation** folder.

## Samples

There are examples how to use the SDK and create various types of request. The file is located in the **dist** folder - **samples.html**
To run it, you need to build the source code of the SDK. 
Then replace **my_sandbox_location** with the server location you are using.

```js
var options = {
    serviceUrl: "my_sandbox_location" + "/api/default/"
